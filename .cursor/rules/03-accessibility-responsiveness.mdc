# Accessibility and Responsiveness

This rule ensures the application is usable by everyone, everywhere.

## Accessibility

- **Compliance**: All components and pages must be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA standards.
- **Semantic HTML**: Use semantic HTML elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, etc.) to structure content correctly.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Use appropriate ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles and attributes where necessary, especially for complex or dynamic components.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be fully accessible and operable via keyboard.
- **Testing**: Regularly use accessibility testing tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) to audit components and pages.

## Responsive Design

- **Multi-Device Support**: The application layout must be fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Breakpoints**: Use PatternFly's standard breakpoints for media queries to ensure consistency with the design system.
- **Fluid Layouts**: Use flexible grids, images, and typography to allow the layout to adapt to different screen sizes. Avoid fixed widths.

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: The application must support the latest two major versions of modern web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge.
