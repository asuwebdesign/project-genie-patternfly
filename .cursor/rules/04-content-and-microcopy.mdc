# Content and Microcopy

This rule governs the voice, tone, and formatting of all user-facing text.

## Brand Voice and Tone

- **Standard**: All microcopy (button labels, tooltips, error messages, form placeholders, etc.) must adhere to the Red Hat brand personality standards.
- **Core Principles**:
  - **Be direct and clear**: Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid jargon.
  - **Be helpful and supportive**: Guide the user and provide context.
  - **Be authentic and genuine**: Write in a human, conversational tone.
  - **Be passionate and inspiring**: Convey confidence and expertise.
- **Reference**: For detailed guidance, always refer to the official Red Hat Brand Standards: https://www.redhat.com/en/about/brand/standards/personality

## Formatting

- **Capitalization**: Use sentence case for titles, headings, and labels unless brand guidelines specify otherwise.
- **Punctuation**: Use punctuation for clarity and to maintain a professional tone.
